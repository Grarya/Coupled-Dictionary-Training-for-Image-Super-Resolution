# Coupled-Dictionary-Training-for-Image-Super-Resolution
Example of MATLAB code for the algorithm proposed in the paper: "Coupled Dictionary Training for Image Super-Resolution" by Jianchao Yang et al. 
Part of the code is used from the code implemented by the author in the following link: http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~jyang29/, which corresponds to an example of MATLAB code for the algorithm proposed in "Image super-resolution via sparse representation" TIP 2010.

To run the training and change the parameters to run it use: Coupled_Dictionary_Training.m. 
To use the trained dictionary: Demo_SR.m

Remember to change the dictionary according to the desired one in the Demo_SR.m.

NOTE: The up_scale value has to be the same for both.
